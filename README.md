**BCG Data Science Project**

**Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing**

In the initial phase of the project, I meticulously studied the business context and framed hypotheses that would drive our data-driven solutions. Understanding the intricate relationship between data and the real-world business problem was key. This phase equipped me not only with the knowledge of data science but also with the ability to communicate complex concepts to stakeholders effectively.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase was a fascinating dive into the data. It involved programming, statistical analysis, and data visualization. Through EDA, I uncovered hidden patterns and insights within the dataset, setting the stage for subsequent phases.

**Feature Engineering & Modelling**

Feature engineering and modelling were the heart of this project. I applied creativity to craft meaningful features and built mathematical models to predict churn probability. The journey involved fine-tuning models, assessing their performance, and refining them to deliver accurate predictions.

**Findings & Recommendations**

In the final phase of the project, I presented the findings and actionable recommendations to the client. Clear synthesis and effective client communication were pivotal in conveying the results. I also delved into model interpretation, explaining how the models aligned with the business problem and what insights they provided.
